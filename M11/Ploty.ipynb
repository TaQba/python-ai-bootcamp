Using *convert types* a numeric\n            string in trace data may be treated as a number during\n            automatic axis `type` detection. Defaults to\n            layout.autotypenumbers.\n        calendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and `tick0`\n            if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar\n            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in\n            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`\n        categoryarray\n            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `categoryorder`.\n        categoryarraysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `categoryarray`.\n        categoryorder\n            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of\n            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\",\n            which specifies the order that is present in the data\n            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow\n            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`\n            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order\n            should be determined by the numerical order of the\n            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the\n            min, max, sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all\n            the values.\n        color\n            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis\n            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid\n            color is lightened by blending this with the plot\n            background Individual pieces can override this.\n        constrain\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing\n            the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is\n            \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\"\n            otherwise.\n        constraintoward\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines which direction we push the\n            originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^",

Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode.

Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^"

This does not set the calendar\n            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in\n            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`\n        categoryarray\n            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `categoryorder`.\n        categoryarraysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `categoryarray`.\n        categoryorder\n            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of\n            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\",\n            which specifies the order that is present in the data\n            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow\n            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`\n            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order\n            should be determined by the numerical order of the\n            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the\n            min, max, sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all\n            the values.\n        color\n            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis\n            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid\n            color is lightened by blending this with the plot\n            background Individual pieces can override this.\n        constrain\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing\n            the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is\n            \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\"\n            otherwise.\n        constraintoward\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines which direction we push the\n            originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^",

Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode.

Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^"

Defaults to\n            layout.autotypenumbers.\n        calendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and `tick0`\n            if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar\n            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in\n            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`\n        categoryarray\n            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `categoryorder`.\n        categoryarraysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `categoryarray`.\n        categoryorder\n            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of\n            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\",\n            which specifies the order that is present in the data\n            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow\n            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`\n            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order\n            should be determined by the numerical order of the\n            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the\n            min, max, sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all\n            the values.\n        color\n            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis\n            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid\n            color is lightened by blending this with the plot\n            background Individual pieces can override this.\n        constrain\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing\n            the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is\n            \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\"\n            otherwise.\n        constraintoward\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines which direction we push the\n            originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^",

By default, plotly uses \"trace\",\n            which specifies the order that is present in the data\n            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow\n            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`\n            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order\n            should be determined by the numerical order of the\n            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the\n            min, max, sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all\n            the values.\n        color\n            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis\n            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid\n            color is lightened by blending this with the plot\n            background Individual pieces can override this.\n        constrain\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing\n            the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is\n            \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\"\n            otherwise.\n        constraintoward\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines which direction we push the\n            originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\".

Used with `categoryorder`.\n        categoryarraysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `categoryarray`.\n        categoryorder\n            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of\n            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\",\n            which specifies the order that is present in the data\n            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow\n            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`\n            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order\n            should be determined by the numerical order of the\n            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the\n            min, max, sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all\n            the values.\n        color\n            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis\n            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid\n            color is lightened by blending this with the plot\n            background Individual pieces can override this.\n        constrain\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing\n            the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is\n            \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\"\n            otherwise.\n        constraintoward\n            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its\n            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the\n            other axis), determines which direction we push the\n            originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^",

Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*\n            or *category descending* if order should be determined\n            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set\n            `categoryorder` to \"array\" to derive the ordering from\n            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not\n            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting\n            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the\n            \"trace\" mode.

Options are \"left\",\n            \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\",\n            \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes.\n        dividercolor\n            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        dividerwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an\n            effect on \"multicategory\" axes.\n        domain\n            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).\n        dtick\n            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with\n            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings\n            available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis `type`\n            is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n\n            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at\n            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks\n            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to\n            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special\n            values; \"L<f>\", where `f` is a positive number, gives\n            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For\n            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = \"L0.5\" will put ticks\n            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus\n            small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\"\n            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".\n            If the axis `type` is \"date\", then you must convert the\n            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.\n            \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks\n            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive\n            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,\n            set `tick0` to \"2000-01-15\" and `dtick` to \"M3\". To set\n            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to \"M48\"\n        exponentformat\n            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.\n            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If\n            \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If\n            \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super\n            script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B.\n        fixedrange\n            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If\n            true, then zoom is disabled.\n        gridcolor\n            Sets the color of the grid lines.\n        griddash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        gridwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n        hoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        insiderange\n            Could be used to set the desired inside range of this\n            axis (excluding the labels) when `ticklabelposition` of\n            the anchored axis has \"inside\". Not implemented for\n            axes with `type` \"log\". This would be ignored when\n            `range` is provided.\n        labelalias\n            Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For\n            example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to\n            USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown\n            must match the keys exactly, after adding any\n            tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the\n            minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the\n            regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n            instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis\n            type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired)\n            can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n        layer\n            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If\n            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the\n            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is\n            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the\n            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like\n            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n            and/or text nodes above this axis.\n        linecolor\n            Sets the axis line color.\n        linewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n        matches\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding\n            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes\n            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram\n            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in\n            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is\n            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes\n            must have the same `type`.\n        maxallowed\n            Determines the maximum range of this axis.\n        minallowed\n            Determines the minimum range of this axis.\n        minexponent\n            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.\n            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is \"SI\" or\n            \"B\".\n        minor\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        mirror\n            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored\n            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the\n            axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and\n            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If\n            \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes\n            subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are\n            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.\n        nticks\n            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be\n            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to\n            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"auto\".\n        overlaying\n            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on\n            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces\n            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis\n            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,\n            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-\n            numbered axis will be visible.\n        position\n            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space\n            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if\n            `anchor` is set to \"free\".\n        range\n            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is\n            \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range\n            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range\n            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is \"date\", it should\n            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects\n            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to\n            strings. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should be\n            numbers, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears. Leaving either or both elements `null` impacts\n            the default `autorange`.\n        rangebreaks\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        rangebreakdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets\n            the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks\n        rangemode\n            If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the\n            extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\", the range\n            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If\n            \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of\n            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.\n        rangeselector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        rangeslider\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        scaleanchor\n            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range\n            of this axis changes together with the range of the\n            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per\n            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still\n            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom\n            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`\n            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the\n            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you\n            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis\n            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect\n            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across\n            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:\n            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the\n            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid\n            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.\n            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a\n            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently\n            forbidden. Setting `false` allows to remove a default\n            constraint (occasionally, you may need to prevent a\n            default `scaleanchor` constraint from being applied,\n            eg. when having an image trace `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            \"x\"}` is set automatically in order for pixels to be\n            rendered as squares, setting `yaxis: {scaleanchor:\n            false}` allows to remove the constraint).\n        scaleratio\n            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,\n            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For\n            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this\n            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on\n            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an\n            elevation profile where the vertical scale is\n            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the\n            horizontal.\n        separatethousands\n            If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n        showdividers\n            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between\n            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes.\n        showexponent\n            If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their\n            significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the\n            first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of\n            the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear.\n        showgrid\n            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If\n            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n        showline\n            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is\n            drawn.\n        showspikes\n            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are\n            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when\n            hovermode = closest\n        showticklabels\n            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n        showtickprefix\n            If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.\n            If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a\n            prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with\n            a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\n        showticksuffix\n            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n        side\n            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the\n            \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting\n            area.\n        spikecolor\n            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series\n            color\n        spikedash\n            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string\n            (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or\n            \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg\n            \"5px,10px,2px,2px\").\n        spikemode\n            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If\n            \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the\n            axis the  series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line\n            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes\n            \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on\n            the axis the series is plotted on\n        spikesnap\n            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor\n            or to the closest datapoints.\n        spikethickness\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        tick0\n            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use\n            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is \"log\", then you\n            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set\n            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except\n            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the\n            axis `type` is \"date\", it should be a date string, like\n            date data. If the axis `type` is \"category\", it should\n            be a number, using the scale where each category is\n            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it\n            appears.\n        tickangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the\n            tick labels vertically.\n        tickcolor\n            Sets the tick color.\n        tickfont\n            Sets the tick font.\n        tickformat\n            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display \"09~15~23.46\"\n        tickformatstops\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti\n            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible\n            properties\n        tickformatstopdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n            sets the default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops\n        ticklabelindex\n            Only for axes with `type` \"date\" or \"linear\". Instead\n            of drawing the major tick label, draw the label for the\n            minor tick that is n positions away from the major\n            tick. E.g. to always draw the label for the minor tick\n            before each major tick, choose `ticklabelindex` -1.\n            This is useful for date axes with `ticklabelmode`\n            \"period\" if you want to label the period that ends with\n            each major tick instead of the period that begins\n            there.\n        ticklabelindexsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticklabelindex`.\n        ticklabelmode\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"date\" When set to \"period\",\n            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period\n            between ticks.\n        ticklabeloverflow\n            Determines how we handle tick labels that would\n            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the\n            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide\n            past domain*. Otherwise on \"category\" and\n            \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other\n            cases the default is *hide past div*.\n        ticklabelposition\n            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to\n            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect\n            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\".\n            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when\n            `ticklabelmode` is set to \"period\". Has no effect on\n            \"multicategory\" axes or when `tickson` is set to\n            \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by `matches` or\n            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would\n            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.\n        ticklabelshift\n            Shifts the tick labels by the specified number of\n            pixels in parallel to the axis. Positive values move\n            the labels in the positive direction of the axis.\n        ticklabelstandoff\n            Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis\n            tick labels and their default position. A positive\n            `ticklabelstandoff` moves the labels farther away from\n            the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is \"outside\", and\n            deeper into the plot area if `ticklabelposition` is\n            \"inside\". A negative `ticklabelstandoff` works in the\n            opposite direction, moving outside ticks towards the\n            plot area and inside ticks towards the outside. If the\n            negative value is large enough, inside ticks can even\n            end up outside and vice versa.\n        ticklabelstep\n            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the\n            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means\n            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every\n            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick\n            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.\n            Not implemented for axes with `type` \"log\" or\n            \"multicategory\", or when `tickmode` is \"array\".\n        ticklen\n            Sets the tick length (in px).\n        tickmode\n            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number\n            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If \"linear\", the\n            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting\n            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (\"linear\" is\n            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).\n            If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via\n            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (\"array\" is\n            the default value if `tickvals` is provided). If\n            \"sync\", the number of ticks will sync with the\n            overlayed axis set by `overlaying` property.\n        tickprefix\n            Sets a tick label prefix.\n        ticks\n            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this\n            axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"),\n            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n        tickson\n            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with\n            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an\n            effect for axes of `type` \"category\" or\n            \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and\n            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom\n            of labels.\n        ticksuffix\n            Sets a tick label suffix.\n        ticktext\n            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via\n            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to\n            \"array\". Used with `tickvals`.\n        ticktextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ticktext`.\n        tickvals\n            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.\n            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to \"array\".\n            Used with `ticktext`.\n        tickvalssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `tickvals`.\n        tickwidth\n            Sets the tick width (in px).\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        type\n            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to\n            determined the axis type by looking into the data of\n            the traces that referenced the axis in question.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis\n            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:\n            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n        visible\n            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving\n            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a\n            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false\n        zeroline\n            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the\n            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn\n            on top of the grid lines.\n        zerolinecolor\n            Sets the line color of the zero line.\n        zerolinewidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.\n        \nDid you mean \"tickfont\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont\n^^^^^^^^^"
